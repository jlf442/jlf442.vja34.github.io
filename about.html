    Who are Poke Face?
   </h2>
    <p>We are a small group of fish loving, life living, and grub cooking free spirits who saw a need for a high quality food truck that serves high quality poke to our community. Currently we travel around Northern Arizona delivering great food to all types of customers. Our home is Flagstaff, Arizona and we go back to Flagstaff every other week to stock up and perform routine maintenance on our truck and machinery. If you want to explore more about who we are then head on over to our "hours and locations" tab to find our weekly schedule with updated locations! Check back often as we travel around in search of new communities to deliver fresh high quality poke to. </p>
