        Here at Poke Face we strive on serving the freshest ingredients with great customer service to match it. Quality assurance is very important to us and we have a team dedicated to making sure we meet these high standards.

      Cold Chain     
    </h2>
      We gurantee that our products stay cold all the way from harvest to consumption to uphold our high quality standards. Recevied shipments with any temperatures that are outside the acceptable limits are rejected and returned immediately. Every half  hour we check and record the temperatrues for all of our produce and perishable products stored in freezers and refrigerators.
      
    <h2>
      Recall Plan and System
    </h2>
      Our receiving department has a strict plan and set of guidelines to follow in the event of the recall of any of our produce or invetory items. We have also created a communications system which tracks company recall notices in real time and sends alerts to our receiving department supervisor immeditately. Our strict recall plan and communications systems ensure that our customers receive the freshest ingredients and are protected from consuming recalled produce.
